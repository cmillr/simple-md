# Things to Be Improved In SimpleMD #

1. **robots.txt and sitemap.xml**: SimpleMD should be able 
to generate each of these items based on the contents of the
website file tree.  Global settings should turn this on, or
to block everything altogether.

2. **Page Titles**: SimpleMD should be able to generate a 
page title for each page based on the first heading in each
markdown document, or failing that, the first ~60 characters
of your file text.
